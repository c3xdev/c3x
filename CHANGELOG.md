# Changelog

All notable changes to c3x are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- `--show-delta` flag for `c3x estimate`: shows only resources with
  plan actions (create/update/delete) annotated with `+`/`~`/`-`
  markers, summarizes unchanged resources in a footer, and displays a
  cost delta line. Only meaningful for plan JSON input; warns and falls
  back to the standard view when used with `.tf` files.
- `optional()` type-constraint defaults are now resolved for both root
  and child module variables through Terraform's own `typeexpr` type
  system. Explicit `optional(type, default)` defaults are applied, bare
  `optional(type)` attributes materialize as null, and `map`/`list` of
  `object(...)` wrappers are handled — matching Terraform's runtime
  behavior instead of bespoke, partial extraction.

### Fixed

- Plan parser: `provider_config.expressions` no longer panics on
  array-valued expressions (e.g. azurerm `features` block in
  Terraform 4.x). Uses `json.RawMessage` with graceful skip.
- Registry modules that assign an attribute through an `optional()`
  object input now reflect the real value instead of silently falling
  back to the catalogue default. Previously an input typed
  `map(object({ instance_class = optional(string) }))` left the
  attribute absent, so an expression like
  `try(coalesce(each.value.instance_class, var.cluster_instance_class),
  null)` errored on the missing attribute, `try()` swallowed it to null,
  and the resource priced at the default class — the delta column missed
  the change entirely (e.g. terraform-aws-modules/rds-aurora). (#53)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

First public release.

### Inputs

- Terraform (`.tf`) parsing — variables, locals, `count`, `for_each`,
  and module resolution (local and registry/git sources).
- Terraform plan JSON.
- Terragrunt (`terragrunt.hcl`) — `terraform.source`, `inputs`,
  `include` walking, and locals resolution.
- CloudFormation templates (YAML and JSON).

### Pricing

- Live pricing from `pricing.c3x.dev`, loaded remote-first: the
  `/catalog` knowledge base, then an on-disk SQLite cache, then an
  embedded snapshot for fully-offline use (`--offline`).
- Declarative TOML catalog with an `expr`-based dimension evaluator.
- `verify_catalog` health harness classifying every kind as
  live / static / free / zero / errored.

### Output

- Per-resource cost breakdowns with monthly totals and multi-currency
  display.
- `c3x diff` against a saved baseline, with budget gates (`--budget`).
- Recommendations: gp2→gp3, EBS right-sizing, non-prod Multi-AZ RDS
  downgrade, idle EIP audit, Azure burstable swap, GCP
  pd-standard→pd-balanced, and cross-resource NAT consolidation with
  net-savings math.
- `--what-if` overrides and usage files for usage-driven dimensions.
- Formats: text, markdown, JSON, JUnit, HTML, CSV, SARIF.
- PR comments for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.
- Rego policy gates (`c3x policy eval`).

### Tooling

- 5-layer configuration (defaults → user → project → env → flags).
- `c3x doctor` pre-flight checks; `c3x pricing` cache inspection.
- Single static binary; Homebrew, Docker (GHCR), and install-script
  distribution.
